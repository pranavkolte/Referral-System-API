# Referral-System-API


### Referral Reward 

### How It Works
1. A new user registers and provides a referral code.
2. The provided referral code is stored in the `referral_code` column.
3. The system matches this code with existing `referral_id` values.
4. If a match is found, the referring user receives reward points.
